## Setup
- [install nodejs >=18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- run `npm install` in the repository folder
- create a `.env` file based on the `.env.template` file, while setting your `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` for your [spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps)
- also checkout and run the [polling server](https://github.com/PTI-UHH/spotify-playback-poller)
- start the react app locally with `npm run dev`, which starts the server under `http://localhost:3000`
